# Phone Book - A CRUD Application with React and TypeScript

This project is a simple phone book application that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) contacts. Each contact has a unique ID, name, and phone number.

The application is built using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (v18.2.0): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v5.0.2): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (v4.3.9): A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
